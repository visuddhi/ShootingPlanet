# ShootingPlanet

This is a demo of a web-based shooting game platform via blockchain. Currently, it allows trades between players on the items they can use in the game. The project has been run on Ethereum test networks.

Still a very early version, any suggestions, contributions are welcome!

How to use it:

1. Install Ganache, Truffle. And installing the Chrome extension Metamask is also highly recommended in order to enjoy the full functionality of this project.

2. Clone the project, run "truffle compile" and "truffle migrate" in the main directory.

3. Run "npm run dev" to enjoy the game!

4. Note: this is not a perfect version yet, sometimes needs to refresh the page so as to use the market normally, since now the deployment of multiple contracts might not succeed due to asynchronous communications. So I also would recommend when using this project, let the Chrome console be in the sight.

5. Feel free to contact me (hqin@mit.edu) for further quesions.
